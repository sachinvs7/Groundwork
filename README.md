# Groundwork
Used the Iris dataset to understand concepts in machine learning.
Tested 6 different algorithms - LR, KNN, LDA, GNB, SVM and CART.
Explored other aspects including confusion matrix and classification report. Best performing algorithm was KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) with a test set accuracy of 90%.
